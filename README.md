### Problem Statement
The Digimon trading card game released world-wide in January 2021. It isn't as popular as the top 
trading card games such as Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, or Magic the Gathering. With a website dedicated to 
only trading and selling Digimon cards, and with the addition of users being able to talk to one another 
through thread posts about the latest Digimon cards or the trading card game in general. It will hopefully 
boost the popularity of the Digimon trading card game and prevent it from losing popularity and disappearing 
from the trading card game industry.
